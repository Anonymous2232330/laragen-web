# LARA-Gen: Enabling Continuous Emotion Control for Music Generation Models via Latent Affective Representation Alignment

This is the anonymous repository for the paper "LARA-Gen: Enabling Continuous Emotion Control for Music Generation Models via Latent Affective Representation Alignment". LARA-Gen is a music generation model capable of producing high-quality music conditioned on continuous valence–arousal emotion labels (e.g., valence: 2.9, arousal: 4.6).

We provide the emotion evaluation part of LARA-Gen, including the Emotion Predictor and the emotion test set.
The Emotion Predictor estimates continuous valence–arousal values for a given music sample.
